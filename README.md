#### Rikimaru Bot

- *Konichiwa!* I am an **anime discord bot** that shows next **episode countdown/schedule**. I can synchronize you **MAL account** like a good boy. I can also let you subscribe to an anime and DM you when an episode is aired like an alarm clock.

###### *Anime Commands:*

> `-when anime name or keyword` command where you can see the countdown for next episode of most anime. Anime that lacks information from the source will sometimes display **null** or **undefined**.

> `-dmwhen anime name or keyword` the same with `-when` it just dm you with the result.

> `-sub anime name or keyword` command where you can subscribe to an ongoing or soon to be release anime. The bot will dm you when an episode is aired.

> `-dmsub anime name or keyword` the same with `-sub` it just dm you with the result.

> `-unsub anime name or keyword` command where you can unsubscribe to an anime.

> `-dmunsub anime name or keyword` the same with `-unsub` it just dm you with the result.

> `-malbind malusername` command required before using `-malsync`. You will need to put a code given by the bot in you **MAL About Section**. You can then remove it after verification.

> `-malsync` command where you can sync your **MAL account's** *currently watching list* to your subscription. Any anime that *exists in your subscription* that *doesn't exists on the list* will be removed.

> `-viewsubs` command where you can view your own subscriptions with the countdowns. You can also **@mention** *as a parameter* with this command to view other's subscription.

> `-dmviewsubs` the same with `-viewsubs` it just dm you with the result.

##### *Other Commands:*
