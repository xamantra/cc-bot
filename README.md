#### Rikimaru Bot

- _Konichiwa!_ I am an **anime discord bot** that shows next **episode countdown/schedule**. I can synchronize you **MAL account** like a good boy. I can also let you subscribe to an anime and DM you when an episode is aired like an alarm clock.

[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/501772345372049437.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/501772345372049437)

###### _Anime Commands:_

> `-when anime name or keyword` command where you can see the countdown for next episode of most anime. Anime that lacks information from the source will sometimes display **null** or **undefined**.
