#### C.C. Bot

- _Konichiwa!_ I am an **anime discord bot** that shows next **episode countdown/schedule**. I can synchronize your **MAL account** like a good boy. I can also let you subscribe to an anime and DM you when an episode is aired like an alarm clock.

###### _Anime Commands:_

> `cc-when anime name or keyword` command where you can see the countdown for next episode of most anime. Anime that lacks information from the source will sometimes display **null** or **undefined**.

> `cc-dmwhen anime name or keyword` the same with `cc-when` it just dm you with the result.

> `cc-sub anime name or keyword` command where you can subscribe to an ongoing or soon to be release anime. The bot will dm you when an episode is aired.

> `cc-dmsub anime name or keyword` the same with `cc-sub` it just dm you with the result.

> `cc-unsub anime name or keyword` command where you can unsubscribe to an anime.

> `cc-dmunsub anime name or keyword` the same with `cc-unsub` it just dm you with the result.

> `cc-malbind malusername` command required before using `cc-malsync`. You will need to put a code given by the bot in you **MAL About Section**. You can then remove it after verification.
